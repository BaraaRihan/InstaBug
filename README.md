Thank you for the opportunity and for sending the Challenge phase. I completed Task 1, Task 2, and also the Test Automation task.
Despite encountering some difficulties with sharing the tasks on GitHub, particularly in structuring the work I created using Atlassian Tools (Trello, Jira, Zephyr Scale) for test scenarios, suites, and cases, 
I found the tasks enjoyable and relatively great to work on.

However, despite my best efforts, I wasn't able to share the work on GitHub in the structured manner I had envisioned. However,
I prefer accessing the work I've done via Google Drive, especially since I've uploaded a video showing the steps to access my tasks. Here is the Google Drive link: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aZ7aUl-4nEhkSZ6u0s68xz88LLshBOiY?usp=sharing) .
I extensively researched various resources to learn how to showcase test suites and folders designed by the tools on GitHub, but unfortunately, I didn't find a suitable solution.

In summary, I'm confident in my ability to discuss anything written in the tasks.
I genuinely enjoyed completing them. Continuous learning is essential, as skills tend to fade if not practiced regularly. 
Joining the team would provide me with the opportunity to develop and enhance my skills, which I am eager to do. I assure you of my dedication and hard work.

I'm looking forward to the next steps in the interview process.

Best regards,
Baraa
